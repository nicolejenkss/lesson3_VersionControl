            </h2>
            <p class="lead">1.	One key concept from Lesson 3 is the advantages of using Versioning Control System.  This system automatically notes revision history, which is who made changes to the project, when they made the change, what was new about the change, and merges changes to the same file. There are many advantages to using Version control. The main one is that is solves file-sharing problems. Also, files cannot be overwritten and you can revert back to an older version. It will then also backup your files, which is extremely important. It can be used when working with a group, or when working by your own self on a project. The topic interests me because I have to work on many group assignments for classes, including this one, and this will make it more efficient. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">2.	Another key concept is why a user would want to use GIT.  GIT is a free and open source distributed version control system.  One benefit of using it is that every user has their own copy on their own computer.  More benefits are that everything is local, there is no single point of failure, it runs fast, and it will prevent people from unintentionally overwriting files on the shared repository. It is able to keep its efficiency while handling both large and small projects.  Additionally, it is very easy to learn, and has features such as cheap local branching, convenient stages areas, and multiple workflows.  GIT is very interesting to me because I have heard people talk about its benefits, but did not know what it is until now. In this class, we will use GitHub to publish our assignments. We will be able to show these assignments to future employers, to show them what we have accomplished. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">3.	Another important concept is the three states that your file can reside in while using GIT are committed, modified, and stages. The stage of committed is when the file is saved and stored on your local database. Modified is when there have been changes to the file but they are not committed to the database yet. The final one, staged, is when the current version is marked a modified version to go into your next commit snapshot. The good thing about these states and the GIT database is that there is not way to mess up of undo things you have done. This interests me because it allows me to take risks and try things to see what works best, allowing me to learn more.  In this class, we will be learning about these three different stages and how the work. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT History</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">4.	Another key concept is the history of GIT, which helps the user understand more about it.  It started when the people who developed the Linux Kernel, an open source software project, and the company that developed BitKeeper lost their relationship. This then led the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, and his team to develop their own system. They wanted it to have speed, a simple design, strong support for non-linear development, be fully distributed, and able to handle large projects. GIT was developed in 2005 and consisted of all of these qualities. Since then, it has gotten even more efficient and widely used for all types of projects. I like how GIT was created because of a falling out with another company. This hardship led them to an amazing discovery that will help us learn more in this class. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">5.	An important concept to understand is the basic GIT commands. These are always going to be used when using this system, which makes then necessary.  Some very important ones are “git init”, which is used to initialize a GIT repository. Next, “git status” is used to see the current state of the project.  Then, to add to the staging area use “git add ‘name of file’”.  To store the changes you have to use the commit command, by typing in “git commit-m” followed by a phrase saying what was changed.  “git pull” is used to fetch from and merge with another repository or local branch and “git push” is used to update remote refs along with associated objects. These git commands are what I will need to know to be successful in this class, because they are what make your project successful. I am interested in learning more on how these commands work exactly, and the different things they can do. </p>
